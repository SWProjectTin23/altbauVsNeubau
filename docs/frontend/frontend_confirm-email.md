# Confirm Email Page Documentation

## Overview

The **Confirm Email Page** is a dedicated interface for users to complete the double-opt-in process for alert notifications.  
When a user enters a new alert email address on the Warnings/Thresholds page, a confirmation email is sent containing a unique token.  
The user must visit the Confirm Email page (usually via a link in the email) to verify their address and activate alert notifications.

## Main Features

- **Token Verification:**  
  The page reads the confirmation token from the URL query parameters and sends it to the backend API for validation.
- **Status Feedback:**  
  The page displays clear feedback based on the confirmation result:
  - Pending: "Best채tige deine E-Mail-Adresse..."
  - Success: "Deine E-Mail-Adresse wurde erfolgreich best채tigt. Du erh채ltst nun Alerts."
  - Error: "Best채tigung fehlgeschlagen." (e.g., invalid or expired token)
- **Navigation:**  
  After confirmation, users can return to the dashboard with a single click.

## Technical Details

- **Component:**  
  - `src/pages/ConfirmEmail.jsx`
- **Logic:**  
  - Uses React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`) to handle token extraction and API communication.
  - Utilizes `useSearchParams` from `react-router-dom` to read the token from the URL.
  - Calls the backend endpoint `/confirm_email` via POST with the token.
  - Displays status messages based on the API response.
- **Styling:**  
  - Uses global styles and a visually distinct info box for feedback.
  - Button for navigation back to the dashboard.

## User Experience

- **Guided Confirmation:**  
  Users are informed about the confirmation status at every step.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Invalid or missing tokens result in clear error messages.
- **Simple Navigation:**  
  After confirmation, users can easily return to the main dashboard.
